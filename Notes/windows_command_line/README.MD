# Windows Command Line

TryHackMe's Windows Command Line room. This is part of the 'Cyber Security 101' learning path and is part of the 'Command Line' Module.

It consists of the following Tasks:
Task 1: Introduction
Task 2: Basic System Information
Task 3: Network Troubleshooting
Task 4: File and Disk Management
Task 5: Task and Process Management
Task 6: Conclusion


## Task 2: Basic Information:

### Notes:
- Before issuing commands, we should note that we can only issue commands within the Windows Path.
- Can issue the command 'set' to check the path from the command line.
- Terminal output shows the path where MS Windows will execute the command, indicated by a line starting with 'Path='

- Can use the 'systeminfo' command to get the system information of the device

- Tip: By piping a command through something like 'more', you can display output page by page, particularly useful if you are expecting a long output. You can exit this with 'ctrl+c'

## Task 3 + 4:
### Notes:
- I am already aware of networking troubleshooting through the command line, along with the file and disk management tasks, as I use this frequently to troubleshoot issues as a Service Desk Analyst, so I have skipped the notes for this section. It was useful to go over this once again, however.


## Task 6: Conclusion:
